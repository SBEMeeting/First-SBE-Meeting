The first virtual meeting of Systematic, Biogeography & Evolution (SBE)purpose is to reach people who usually have economic restrictions to access to most of the scientific meetings on different areas within evolutionary biology. The SBE meeting is coordinated mostly by young interdisciplinary Latin American scientists, supporting and promoting the active and equitable participation of all genders in this meeting.

The event will take place on mid-July via zoom sessions. Each invited talk in the symposium will take 15 minutes, while the audience will have the opportunity to ask any clarifying questions for 5 minutes. The language of the talks are elegible by the speakers (from: english, spanish or portuguese). But slides/presentations and multimedia must be in english.

Hope to see you there!
